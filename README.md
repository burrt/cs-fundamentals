![Build Status](https://github.com/burrt/cs-fundamentals/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

This contains a bunch of Computer Science fundamentals such as sorting and searching algorithms, data structures etc. In the future it should also incorporate coding best practices, CI/CD and more.

Over time also include various code snippets for Hackerrank and other small experiments that aren't worth spinning off into its own repository.
