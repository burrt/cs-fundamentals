# Sorting Algorithms

A few basic sorting algorithms in Java. I have migrated the previous Java project to a Gradle project as it
simplifies building, testing and developing.

## Getting started

1. I recommend IntelliJ IDEA
2. Open the `sorts` project
3. Open the Gradle Tool Window
4. Execute Tasks -> verification -> test
5. Execute `main` in `src/main/java/Sorts.java`
